        <p>I am an applied physics student but I have also developed a passion for programming. Some
        of my work can be seen on my GitHub page (above). I got started with Matlab and coding macros 
        for Excel but recently have moved to Java as my language of choice. I am interested in making
        small games and understanding efficiencies in code.</p>
