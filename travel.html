        <p>I have been to Italy and Greece while in grade school and Went down to Peru and Bolivia in the 
        summer of 2014. Both of these experiences have been amazing and I have met some really cool people.
        A highlight from my last trip was getting stuck on a bus behind a landslide for 2 days in the Bolivian 
        rainforest. This was followed by 2 more days barricaded in a small trucking town because of protests!</p>
