        <p>I would describe my snowboarding style as free-ride/big-mountain. I enjoy getting fresh lines
        and I won't shy away from a hike. The last couple seasons I have gotten into the back country around
        whistler and have had a blast! I would suggest to anyone who likes powder lines and isn't afraid 
        of a little sweat to get the proper gear and training and start exploring!</p>
